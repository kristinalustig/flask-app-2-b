# REST
# One of the ways to design your web application is to create an internal API so your front end can get data.
# There are lots of different ways different applications do this, but one of the most common ways is to
# create an API using the REST model. This makes it easy to understand what each URL (or endpoint) of your
# application will do to a piece of data, depending on which HTTP method you use (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
# This file contains the API definition for the teams API, which should do the following:

# Method    URL             Description
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GET       /teams          Gets all teams
# GET       /teams/:id      Gets a single team with the ID :id
# POST      /teams          Creates a new team using request body JSON
# PUT       /teams/:id      Replaces the team with ID :id with request body JSON
# PATCH     /teams/:id      Partially updates the team with ID :id with the request body JSON
# DELETE    /teams/:id      Deletes the team with the ID :id

# Some of these API endpoints are incomplete according to what the REST pattern dictates. It's your job to fix them.
